# Airflow hosted on Azure Container Apps

[![CI](https://github.com/hetvip2/airflow-hosted-on-aca/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hetvip2/airflow-hosted-on-aca/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A self-contained [Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/)
template that **hosts Apache Airflow on Azure Container Apps** and uses it to
orchestrate **Azure Container Apps Jobs**. You run one command, `azd up`, and get
a working Airflow (web + scheduler + triggerer) plus a sample ACA Job for Airflow
to drive — no servers to manage, scale-to-zero job execution, per-execution billing.

> **Two ways to combine Airflow + ACA Jobs**
> - **This repo (you host Airflow):** deploy the whole Airflow control plane on
>   Azure Container Apps. Good when you don't already run Airflow and want a
>   turnkey orchestrator next to your jobs.
> - **[`airflow-on-aca-jobs`](https://github.com/hetvip2/airflow-on-aca-jobs) (host nothing):**
>   drop the same operator into an Airflow you *already* run (Managed Airflow,
>   MWAA, self-hosted) and point it at ACA Jobs. Lowest ownership.
>
> Both share the exact same operator/trigger code, so you can start here and
> graduate to host-nothing later with zero DAG changes.

```

- **Airflow** runs as three Container Apps using **LocalExecutor** (tasks run in
  the scheduler process — simple, no Celery/Redis to operate).
- **DAGs and plugins** are delivered to a mounted **Azure Files** share, so you
  update workflows by re-uploading files — no image rebuild.
- A **user-assigned managed identity** (Contributor on the resource group) lets
  the operator call the ARM Jobs API with **no secrets in Airflow**.
- A **sample ACA Job** is deployed as the "muscle" Airflow drives out of the box.

## Quick start (local, ~5 minutes)

Run the exact same Airflow stack on your laptop with Docker before touching Azure.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hetvip2/airflow-hosted-on-aca
cd airflow-hosted-on-aca

cp .env.example .env        # fill in your ACA Job + auth (see below)
docker compose up --build
```

Open <http://localhost:8080> (user `airflow` / password `airflow`), unpause
`aca_jobs_example`, and **Trigger DAG w/ config** to run your ACA Job.

For a local demo, the quickest auth is a short-lived ARM token:

```bash
az account get-access-token --resource https://management.azure.com --query accessToken -o tsv
# paste into AZURE_ACCESS_TOKEN in .env
```

---

## Deploy to Azure (`azd up`)

### Prerequisites

- [Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)
- [Azure CLI (`az`)](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) (used by the post-deploy upload hook)
- An Azure subscription and `azd auth login`

### Steps

```bash
azd env new my-airflow

# Required secrets (or azd will prompt):
azd env set POSTGRES_ADMIN_PASSWORD "$(openssl rand -base64 24)"
azd env set AIRFLOW_ADMIN_PASSWORD  "$(openssl rand -base64 18)"

azd up
```

`azd up` will:

1. Provision the infrastructure in `infra/main.bicep` (Log Analytics, ACA
   environment, managed identity + role assignment, Postgres, storage + file
   share, the three Airflow apps, and the sample ACA Job).
2. Run the **postprovision hook** (`scripts/upload-dags.*`) to upload `airflow/dags`
   and `airflow/plugins` to the file share.

When it finishes, `azd` prints the Airflow web URL (also `azd env get-values`
→ `AIRFLOW_WEB_URL`). Log in with `airflow` / your `AIRFLOW_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.

### Updating DAGs / plugins later

Edit files under `airflow/`, then re-run the upload hook:

```bash
azd hooks run postprovision       # or: ./scripts/upload-dags.sh
```

Airflow picks up the changes within a minute — no redeploy needed.

### Configurable parameters

| azd env variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AZURE_LOCATION` | _(prompted)_ | Region (Postgres Flexible Server must be available there) |
| `POSTGRES_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | _(required)_ | Postgres admin password |
| `AIRFLOW_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | _(required)_ | Airflow web UI admin password |
| `NAME_PREFIX` | `aflo` | Prefix for resource names |
| `POSTGRES_ADMIN_USER` | `airflowadmin` | Postgres admin login |
| `AIRFLOW_ADMIN_USER` | `airflow` | Airflow web UI admin username |

---

## Running your own jobs

The included DAGs are **parameterized** — you specify your workload at trigger
time, no code changes. The operator reads your job's existing definition and
applies only the overrides you pass, so blank fields keep the job's defaults.

### Single job — `aca_jobs_example`

In the Airflow UI, open `aca_jobs_example` → **Trigger DAG w/ config** and fill
the form:

| Field | What it does | Example |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| **ACA Job name** | Which job to run (blank = the `aca_job_name` Variable) | `nightly-etl` |
| **Command override** | Replace the image entrypoint | `["python", "main.py"]` |
| **Args override** | Arguments for the command | `["--batch-size", "100"]` |
| **Environment variables** | Extra env vars for this run | `{"MODE": "nightly"}` |

Or from the CLI / REST API (for automation and scheduling):

```bash
airflow dags trigger aca_jobs_example \
  --conf '{"job_name":"nightly-etl","command":["python","main.py"],"args":["--batch-size","100"],"env":{"MODE":"nightly"}}'
```

### Parallel fan-out — `aca_jobs_pipeline`

Run the same workload across N parallel ACA Job executions (each shard gets
`SHARD_INDEX` / `SHARD_TOTAL` plus any env you pass):

```bash
airflow dags trigger aca_jobs_pipeline \
  --conf '{"shards":50,"command":["python","worker.py"],"env":{"DATASET":"sales-2026"}}'
```

This is the orchestration ACA cron can't express on its own: dependency-aware
ordering, parallel fan-out, and per-task retries. With `deferrable=True` (the
pipeline default) each execution frees its Airflow worker slot while ACA runs, so
fan-out width is bounded by ACA — not by your Airflow worker count.

### Targeting your own job

To target *your* job instead of the bundled sample, either pass `job_name` at
trigger time or set the Airflow Variables `azure_subscription_id`,
`aca_resource_group`, `aca_job_name` (the infra wires these automatically for the
sample job).

### Authentication options

The operator resolves credentials in this order:

1. **Airflow Connection** (`azure_conn_id`) — service principal, pre-fetched
   token, or managed identity stored as an Airflow Connection. **Auto-refreshes**,
   so use this (or option 3) for long-running pipelines.
2. **`AZURE_ACCESS_TOKEN`** env var — a short-lived (~1h) ARM token. Handy for a
   quick local demo, but it does **not** refresh — long jobs or large fan-outs
   that outlive the token will fail mid-run. Don't use it for production.
3. **`DefaultAzureCredential`** — on Azure this transparently uses the
   **user-assigned managed identity** (no secrets, auto-refreshes). Locally it
   falls back to your `az login` / environment credentials.

On the `azd`-deployed stack, option 3 is automatic via the managed identity — the
recommended production path with no secrets to manage.

## Integrating an external platform

A common scenario: the customer **doesn't already run an orchestrator**, so this
template *becomes* their orchestration layer — and an existing external system
(their app, data platform, or SaaS) needs to kick off the work or react to it.
Airflow is built for exactly this. The external system never has to "be" Airflow;
it just triggers a DAG or exchanges data with one. Three standard patterns:

### 1. Trigger Airflow from outside via its REST API

Any external system can start a workflow with an HTTPS call to the hosted Airflow.
The DAG then fans the work out to ACA Jobs:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://<your-airflow-web-url>/api/v1/dags/aca_jobs_example/dagRuns" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -u "<user>:<password>" \
  -d '{"conf": {"job_name": "nightly-etl", "env": {"DATASET": "sales-2026"}}}'
```

This is the most common integration: the customer's platform passes its arguments
in `conf`, and Airflow orchestrates the ACA Job(s). (Airflow's
[stable REST API](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/stable-rest-api-ref.html)
also lists runs, fetches status, and reads logs, so the caller can poll results.)

### 2. Event-driven trigger

Let an Azure event start the pipeline — e.g. a file landing in Blob Storage or a
message on a bus. Wire **Event Grid → Logic App / Azure Function → Airflow REST
API** (pattern 1), so a customer's upstream system triggers a run with no manual
step. The same REST endpoint above is the integration point.

### 3. Integrate inside the DAG

Put the external system *in the pipeline* as tasks: a DAG can read from an
external queue/storage/API, run the ACA Job, then write results back or send a
webhook/notification on completion. This keeps the integration as code next to the
orchestration, version-controlled with the rest of the DAG.

> In every pattern: **external platform = the trigger / data source**, **this
> hosted Airflow = the orchestrator**, **ACA Jobs = the execution.** Both the
> orchestration and the job execution stay on Azure; the customer's existing
> system simply plugs in.

> The template ships the orchestration core (Airflow + operator + sample job) and
> exposes Airflow's REST API for integration. A connector to a *specific* external
> product is a small, customer-specific add-on (a REST call or a DAG task), not a
> change to this architecture.

## Testing

The operator/trigger have **offline unit tests** (ARM calls mocked — no Azure
needed):

```bash
pip install -e ".[test]"
pytest
```

CI runs these on Python 3.10 and 3.11 and validates that the Bicep compiles.

> Airflow does not run natively on Windows. To run the tests on Windows, use the
> Docker image (`docker run --rm -v "${PWD}:/work" -w /work apache/airflow:2.10.2
> bash -lc "pip install -q pytest ruff && pytest"`).

---

## Validated end-to-end

This template was tested against a **live** Azure Container Apps Job with the
local stack above — single jobs with custom arguments and an 8-shard parallel
pipeline — across three independent runs:

| Validation run | Single job (custom args) | Parallel pipeline | Azure status |
|----------------|--------------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Run A | ✅ success | ✅ 8 shards | Succeeded |
| Run B | ✅ success | ✅ 8 shards | Succeeded |
| Run C | ✅ success | ✅ 8 shards | Succeeded |

All runs confirmed that per-run `command` / `args` / `env` overrides reach the
live ACA execution, deferral frees worker slots while jobs run, and ARM tokens
refresh on `401` mid-poll. The runs collectively drove **100+ successful ACA Job
executions** concurrently with no throttling errors.

---

## Notes & caveats

- **Executor:** LocalExecutor runs tasks **inside the scheduler process** — simple
  and great up to moderate concurrency (validated to ~50 concurrent ACA Job
  executions). For large fan-outs (hundreds–thousands of shards), switch to
  CeleryExecutor/KubernetesExecutor; the operator/DAG code is unchanged. Because
  the operator is **deferrable**, in-flight executions are bounded by ACA, not by
  Airflow worker count — but the scheduler still needs enough parallelism to
  *start* them.
- **Auth for long runs:** use an Airflow Connection or managed identity (both
  auto-refresh). The static `AZURE_ACCESS_TOKEN` is demo-only — see
  [Authentication options](#authentication-options).
- **Networking:** this template uses public ACA ingress and "allow Azure
  services" on Postgres for a fast start. For production, add a VNet + private
  endpoints (the [`n8n-on-aca`](https://github.com/simonjj/n8n-on-aca) template is a good private-networking reference).
- **Least privilege:** the managed identity gets `Contributor` on the resource
  group for simplicity. Scope it to a custom role limited to
  `Microsoft.App/jobs/*/start` + read for production.
- The Bicep is validated by `az bicep build` in CI; a live `azd up` deploy incurs
  Azure costs and is not run in CI.
